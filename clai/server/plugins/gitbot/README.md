# gitbot

`NLP` `Support` `Automation`

This skill lets you manage and organize your github repository in natural language.
It also lets you use natural language commands to issue popular git commands. 

## Implementation

The skill demonstrates hooks into two interesting design patterns:

+ Similar to the [`nlc2cmd`](../nlc2cmd/) skill, it demonstrates natural language to 
command patterns. However, in contrast to the nlc2cmd implementation, here we demonstrate
how to use a natural language classifier local to the machine -- using [RASA](https://rasa.com/) --
instead of calling an external service like [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/). 

+ This skill also demonstrates instances of workflow automation in the context of code 
development by using the [GitHub Actions API](https://github.com/features/actions).

Similar to the `nlc2cmd` and `ibmcloud` skills, this skill is also merely illustrative
of integration of natural language and automation in code management through GitHub.
Contributions are welcome to improve the accuracy of the natural language interpretation,
the breadth of the use cases covered for workflow automation, or new features!

Before trying it out:

> Fill out `sample_config.json` and rename it to `config.json`

> run `./run_rasa.sh 5556`

## Example Usage

If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything.
