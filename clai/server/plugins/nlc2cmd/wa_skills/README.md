# nlc2cmd for IBM Cloud CLI

`NLP` `Support`

This contains scripts that turn the recognized intents into actionable commands on the command line. 
Previously in [../](../) we looked at some common examples using the `tar` and `grep` commands. 
Here we want to highlight another instantiation of the nlc2cmd use case, this time for the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cli).

## Example Usage

The script [cloudbot.py](cloudbot.py) supports some illustrative commands from the [IBM Cloud CLI cheatsheet](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-docs/cli/blob/master/IBM%20Cloud%20CLI%20quick%20reference.pdf). Try these out!
