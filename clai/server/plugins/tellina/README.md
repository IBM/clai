## :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: nlc2cmd Challenge

No one remembers arcane flags to commands we use every day.
The ability to turn natural language instructions to bash commands has been a pipe 
dream for the research community for a while. 
After all, there is a lot of data already out there in public forums and in documentation
that can be readily leveraged. 
Especially with recent advances in natural language processing, 
this problem has received renewed interest.

> Check out [Betty](https://github.com/pickhardt/betty), a ''friendly English-like interface for your command line''.

Most recent attempts (including the ones above) are either heavily rule based or 
do not scale beyond the examples that can be mined reliably from forums. 
As such, it remains an open challenge today.

As part of Project CLAI, we intend to curate and release an open dataset around this 
challenge and host a leaderboard of competing solutions.

I don't know what's worse--the fact that after 15 years of using tar I still can't keep the flags straight, or that after 15 years of technological advancement I'm still mucking with tar flags that were 15 years old when I started.
