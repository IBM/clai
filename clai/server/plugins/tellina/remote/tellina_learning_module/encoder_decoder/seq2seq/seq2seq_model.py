    This class implements a multi-layer recurrent neural network as encoder,
    and an attention-based decoder. This is the same as the model described in
    this paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7449 - please look there for details,
    or into the seq2seq library for complete model implementation.
    This class also allows to use GRU cells in addition to LSTM cells, and
    sampled softmax to handle large output vocabulary size. A single-layer
    version of this model, but with bi-directional encoder, was presented in
      http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473
    and sampled softmax is described in Section 3 of the following paper.
